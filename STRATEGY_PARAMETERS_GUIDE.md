# 🎯 Strategy Parameters & Risk Management Guide

## 📊 Understanding Strategy Parameters

Strategy parameters are the "knobs and dials" that control how your trading strategies work. Think of them as the settings on a car - you can adjust them to make the strategy more aggressive, conservative, or suitable for different market conditions.

## 🔧 Strategy Parameters Explained

### 📈 **RSI Parameters**

#### **RSI Oversold (Default: 30)**
- **What it does**: Determines when a stock is considered "cheap"
- **How it works**: When RSI falls below this level, the strategy thinks the stock is oversold
- **Range**: 20-40
- **Lower values (20-25)**: More aggressive buying (buys sooner)
- **Higher values (35-40)**: More conservative buying (waits for deeper dips)

**Example:**
- RSI Oversold = 20: Strategy buys when RSI hits 20 (very aggressive)
- RSI Oversold = 40: Strategy buys when RSI hits 40 (more conservative)

#### **RSI Overbought (Default: 70)**
- **What it does**: Determines when a stock is considered "expensive"
- **How it works**: When RSI rises above this level, the strategy thinks the stock is overbought
- **Range**: 60-80
- **Lower values (60-65)**: More aggressive selling (sells sooner)
- **Higher values (75-80)**: More conservative selling (waits for higher peaks)

**Example:**
- RSI Overbought = 60: Strategy sells when RSI hits 60 (very aggressive)
- RSI Overbought = 80: Strategy sells when RSI hits 80 (more conservative)

### 📊 **MACD Parameters**

#### **MACD Fast Period (Default: 12)**
- **What it does**: Controls how quickly MACD responds to price changes
- **Range**: 8-16
- **Lower values (8-10)**: More sensitive to short-term changes
- **Higher values (14-16)**: Less sensitive, smoother signals

#### **MACD Slow Period (Default: 26)**
- **What it does**: Controls the baseline for MACD calculations
- **Range**: 20-30
- **Lower values (20-22)**: More responsive to changes
- **Higher values (28-30)**: More stable, fewer false signals

### 🎪 **Bollinger Bands Parameters**

#### **BB Period (Default: 20)**
- **What it does**: How many days to calculate the moving average
- **Range**: 10-30
- **Lower values (10-15)**: More responsive to recent price action
- **Higher values (25-30)**: Smoother, less noisy bands

#### **BB Std Dev (Default: 2.0)**
- **What it does**: How wide the bands are (volatility measure)
- **Range**: 1.5-3.0
- **Lower values (1.5-1.8)**: Tighter bands, more signals
- **Higher values (2.5-3.0)**: Wider bands, fewer signals

## ⚠️ Risk Management Explained

Risk management is like wearing a seatbelt while driving - it protects you from big losses and helps you stay in the game longer.

### 🛡️ **Position Sizing**

#### **Max Position Size (Default: 0.1 = 10%)**
- **What it does**: Limits how much of your portfolio you can invest in one stock
- **Range**: 0.05-0.5 (5%-50%)
- **Lower values (0.05-0.1)**: Conservative, diversifies risk
- **Higher values (0.3-0.5)**: Aggressive, concentrated bets

**Example:**
- Max Position = 0.1: Never invest more than 10% in one stock
- Max Position = 0.3: Can invest up to 30% in one stock

#### **Risk Per Trade (Default: 0.02 = 2%)**
- **What it does**: Maximum amount you're willing to lose on any single trade
- **Range**: 0.01-0.05 (1%-5%)
- **Lower values (0.01-0.02)**: Conservative, small losses
- **Higher values (0.03-0.05)**: Aggressive, larger potential losses

### 🎯 **Stop Loss & Take Profit**

#### **Stop Loss (Default: 0.02 = 2%)**
- **What it does**: Automatically sells if the stock drops by this amount
- **Range**: 0.01-0.1 (1%-10%)
- **Lower values (0.01-0.02)**: Tight stops, quick exits
- **Higher values (0.05-0.1)**: Wide stops, more room for volatility

#### **Take Profit (Default: 0.04 = 4%)**
- **What it does**: Automatically sells if the stock rises by this amount
- **Range**: 0.02-0.2 (2%-20%)
- **Lower values (0.02-0.04)**: Quick profits, frequent trades
- **Higher values (0.1-0.2)**: Bigger profits, fewer trades

## 🎪 How to Use These Parameters

### 🚀 **Step-by-Step Guide**

#### **1. Start Conservative**
- RSI Oversold: 35
- RSI Overbought: 65
- Max Position: 0.1 (10%)
- Risk Per Trade: 0.02 (2%)
- Stop Loss: 0.02 (2%)
- Take Profit: 0.04 (4%)

#### **2. Test Different Settings**
- Run backtests with different parameter combinations
- Compare results using the performance metrics
- Look for the best risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio)

#### **3. Adjust Based on Market Conditions**

**Bull Market (Rising Prices):**
- Lower RSI Oversold (25-30) - Buy dips more aggressively
- Higher Take Profit (0.06-0.08) - Let winners run longer
- Wider Stop Loss (0.03-0.04) - Give stocks room to breathe

**Bear Market (Falling Prices):**
- Higher RSI Oversold (35-40) - Be more selective
- Lower Take Profit (0.02-0.03) - Take profits quickly
- Tighter Stop Loss (0.015-0.02) - Cut losses fast

**Sideways Market (Range-bound):**
- Use Bollinger Bands strategy
- Lower BB Std Dev (1.5-1.8) - More signals
- Shorter BB Period (15-18) - More responsive
